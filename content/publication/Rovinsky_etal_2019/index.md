abstract: The thylacine is popularly used as a classic example of convergent evolution between
placental and marsupial mammals. Despite having a fossil history spanning over
20 million years and known since the 1960s, the thylacine is often presented in both
scientific literature and popular culture as an evolutionary singleton unique in its
morphological and ecological adaptations within the Australian ecosystem. Here, we
synthesise and critically evaluate the current state of published knowledge regarding
the known fossil record of Thylacinidae prior to the appearance of the modern
species. We also present phylogenetic analyses and body mass estimates of the
thylacinids to reveal trends in the evolution of hypercarnivory and ecological shifts
within the family. We find support that <i>Mutpuracinus archibaldi</i> occupies an
uncertain position outside of Thylacinidae, and consider <i>Nimbacinus richi</i> to likely
be synonymous with <i>N. dicksoni</i>. The Thylacinidae were small-bodied (< ~8 kg)
unspecialised faunivores until after the ~15â€“14 Ma middle Miocene climatic
transition (MMCT). After the MMCT they dramatically increase in size and develop
adaptations to a hypercarnivorous diet, potentially in response to the aridification of
the Australian environment and the concomitant radiation of dasyurids. This fossil
history of the thylacinids provides a foundation for understanding the ecology of the
modern thylacine. It provides a framework for future studies of the evolution of
hypercarnivory, cursoriality, morphological and ecological disparity, and
convergence within mammalian carnivores.

abstract: The relative body masses of predators and their prey strongly affect the
predators’ ecology. An accurate estimate of the mass of an extinct predator
is therefore key to revealing its biology and the structure of the ecosystem it
inhabited. Until its extinction, the thylacinewas the largest extant carnivorous
marsupial, but little data exist regarding its body mass, with an average
of 29.5 kg the most commonly used estimate. According to the costs of
carnivory model, this estimate predicts that thylacines would have focused
on prey subequal to or larger than themselves; however, many studies of
their functional morphology suggest a diet of smaller animals. Here, we present
new body mass estimates for 93 adult thylacines, including two
taxidermy specimens and four complete mounted skeletons, representing 40
known-sex specimens, using three-dimensional volumetric model-informed
regressions. We demonstrate that prior estimates substantially overestimated
average adult thylacine body mass. We show mixed-sex population mean
(16.7 kg), mean male (19.7 kg), and mean female (13.7 kg) body masses well
below prior estimates, and below the 21 kg costs of carnivory threshold.
Our data show that the thylacine did not violate the costs of carnivory. The
thylacine instead occupied the 14.5–21 kg predator/prey range characterized
by small-prey predators capable of occasionally switching to relatively
large-bodied prey if necessary.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We calculated the weight of 93 individual adult thylacines using a combination of a global collection of thylacine remains, state-of-the-art three dimensional (3D) scanning, and digital reconstructions. We found that previous ideas of the average thylacine’s weight were almost 80% too big, dramatically changing our interpretation of the thylacine as a predator in the Australian environment.

abstract: The Drimolen palaeocave system has been actively excavated since the 1990s
and has produced a demographically-diverse record of <i>Paranthropus robustus</i>, early
Homo, and a substantial record of early Pleistocene bone tools; all recovered from the
Main Quarry, a single fossil bearing deposit within the system. Early surveys identified
an isolated solution-tube 55 meters west of the Main Quarry filled with decalcified
matrix and fossils (the Drimolen Makondo). Recent excavations into the Makondo have
started to address the geology, depositional history, and faunas of the deposits; particularly
whether the Makondo represents a distant uneroded part of the Main Quarry
infill, or deposits in-filled into a separate entrance within the same system. We present
the first description of fossil macromammalian faunas from the Makondo, excavated
2013â€“2014. A total of 531 specimens were recovered, 268 (50.5%) of which are taxonomically
identifiable. The resulting list is diverse given the sample size and includes
primate and carnivore taxa frequently recovered at other terminal Pliocene and earlier
Pleistocene localities, as well as more rarely encountered species and elements like
the first postcranial remains of the hunting hyaenid (<i>Chasmaporthetes ?nitidula</i>) from
the Cradle. While some of the Makondo fauna overlaps with taxa recovered from the
Main Quarry, there are key differences between the described samples that may reflect
differences in the age of the deposits and/or taphonomic processes between these
deposits at Drimolen.

My research interest lies at the intersection of functional ecology and palaeobiology â€” understanding the ecologic niche of extinct animals using the interplay of morphology and function. I use phylogenetic comparative methods, 3D digital imaging, and morphological data (3D geometric morphometrics and linear morphometrics) to investigate topics such as body size, feeding and locomotor ecology, and convergent evolution within an evolutionary framework.
